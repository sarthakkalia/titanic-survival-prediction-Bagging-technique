# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Bagging Techniques
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using bagging techniques. Three classifier techniques are employed: Decision Tree Classifier, Bagging Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. The classifiers are trained on a dataset containing various attributes of Titanic passengers, such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on these attributes. After training and evaluating the classifiers, the one with the best performance will be selected for deployment.
